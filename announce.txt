Subject: xpdf 4.01-1

The following package has been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* xpdf-4.01-1

Xpdf is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)
files.  (These are also sometimes called 'Acrobat' files, from the
name of Adobe's PDF software.)  The Xpdf viewer uses the Qt
cross-platform GUI toolkit.  The Xpdf project also includes a PDF text
extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and various other utilities.
These are not included in the Cygwin xpdf package because poppler
provides similar utilities.

This is an update to the latest upstream release.  It is primarily a
bugfix release.  See

for more details.
